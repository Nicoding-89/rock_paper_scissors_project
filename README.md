# rock_paper_scissors_project

My first JavaScript learning project tests basic knowledge of functions, conditionals, variables and operators, as well as data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans. The project consists of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors in a best-of-five format, allowing the user to see both the partial results and the final outcome in the browser console.
